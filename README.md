# Data-Mining

There are four branches. The most important script is the "implement.ipynb" in the master branch. "implement2.ipynb" and "implement3.ipynb" are similar to "implement.ipynb" but deal with different datasets. 

The data branch contains all the original datasets. They are all downloaded from https://www.openml.org/

The describe branch contains the results of characterizations of all the processed datasets. 

The output branch contains the results of accuracy and computing time of all the classification computed on all datasets.
